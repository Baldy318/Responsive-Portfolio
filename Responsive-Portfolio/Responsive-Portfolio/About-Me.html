        <img src="assets/images/Percy.1.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Percy">

        <p>  I am a healthcare professsional with 10 plus years of experience in health administration including
          but not limited to orthopaedic pathology, cardiovascular and rheumatological research. I have always 
          felt that there coding is a golden language that can help revolutionize any industry. Whether it's 
          healthcare, business, finance, law or entertainment, coding can amplify and shed light to everywhere
          on this earth where this is a computer and a connection. 
              Being born in Ghana and migrating here when I was younger made me realize that America is 
          filled with opportunities, you initially couldn't grasp elsewhere. It makes you ambitious and resourceful
          of your environment. Coding can help bridge the gaps and progress the world to a better future. </p>
